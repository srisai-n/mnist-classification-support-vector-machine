# mnist-classification-support-vector-machine
 Support Vector Classifier for MNIST Classification

**Summary**
- trained a multi-class support vector classifier with dot-product kernel and 1-norm soft margin to classify MNIST dataset
- used Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy
- also derived the primal-dual relationship of the 1-norm soft margin classifier for both binary and multi-class classification
- part of the course 'CSE 555 - Introduction to Pattern Recognition' at University at Buffalo, SUNY
